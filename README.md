Overview 

The goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company. If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

Data Understanding

There are two groups of employees who left the company: (A) those who worked considerably less than their peers with the same number of projects, and (B) those who worked much more. Of those in group A, it's possible that they were fired. It's also possible that this group includes employees who had already given their notice and were assigned fewer hours because they were already on their way out the door. For those in group B, it's reasonable to infer that they probably quit. The folks in group B likely contributed a lot to the projects they worked in; they might have been the largest contributors to their projects.

Modelling and Evaluation

It appears that employees are leaving the company as a result of poor management. Leaving is tied to longer working hours, many projects, and generally lower satisfaction levels. It can be ungratifying to work long hours and not receive promotions or good evaluation scores. There's a sizeable group of employees at this company who are probably burned out. It also appears that if an employee has spent more than six years at the company, they tend not to leave.

Conclusion

The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked.

To retain employees, the following recommendations could be presented to the stakeholders:

1. Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
2. Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for atleast four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied.
3. Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so.
4. If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear.
5. Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts.
6. High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort.
